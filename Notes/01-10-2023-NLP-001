# What is Natural Language?

Natural language is the language that humans utilize to converse with each other in their day to day lives. Natural language can be of spoken and written form. It is a medium through which humans convey their ideas, thoughts, emotions, actions, and exchange information.  Natural language can be thought of a programming language for our life where we interact with various modules to exchange information which allows us to perform tasks. Natural language is no single language, but it can be thought of as an umbrella term under which a collection of different languages that have evolved with society and humans themselves fall. Even though these languages may vastly differ from each other, most languages follow certain rules that apply to natural language and have some order to them. 

## Why are computer scientists interested in Natural Language?

Since natural language is the way through which humans communicate and exchange information with each other. It would be incredibly useful to us as a society if machines were able to directly understand what we were saying and obey our commands in the language that we are fluent in natively, eliminating the need for mediums like complicated user interfaces. Speaking in natural language abstracts a lot of middleware and would make our lives way easier. Imagine a world where you are able to ask questions to machines as if they were conscious, like talking to your coffee machine or toaster in the morning. This is now partly possible becuase of the advancements in speech recognition. 

## What is Natural Language Processing?

Simply put, natural language processing or NLP is a collection of techniques that focus on making natural human language to be processed and understood by machines and making machines with the goal of them being able to extract information from the language like we do, and make decisions or perform tasks based on the extracted information. It involves techniques that allow us to help machines learn patterns in natural language and learn context. Context refers to the circumstances or information that surrounds a particular word, phrase, or statement and helps in determining its meaning. Context can be affected by different parts of the language and information contained by the language. This is the hard part for making machines understand natural language because it can vary so much. However, as we discussed before, language has some core ground rules.



## What are the components of a language?

Language is a complex tool which we use to communicate and it has various components that are required to work together effectively to sustain proper communication. Themain components of a language include:

- Phonetics - It is how human percieve sound. It defines the correlation between the written medium and the spoken medium. The way something is spoken is often reflected in the way it is written in languages. For example, in the English language, consonants and vowels are a differentiation of letters based on how they are articulated. They can also be based on the loudness of the voice (acoustic), and based on how similar voices are percieved and differentiated (auditory).
- Morphology - It is the study of words and the parts of a word, and the relationship of a word to other words. A **morpheme** is the smallest unit of meaning in a language. It can be a word (like cat, rat), or a part of a word(like a prefix, e.g. "un-"). It also studies homophony, where words that sound similar but have different meanings. Morphemes can also be blended together to form another word, like "black" and "board" form blackboard.
- Syntax -It defines the rules which allows languages to have some consistency and structure to them so that they are interpreted easier. It governs the structure and arrangement of words and phrases so that they make coherent sense.
